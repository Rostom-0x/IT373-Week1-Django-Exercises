# Reflection

The first challenge I faced was getting the right Python version installed and configured appropriately. At first, I had a little bit of trouble with activating the virtual environment due to execution policies on my computer. Eventually, I learned some tricks about how to set the computer policies to allow the scripts to run without any trouble. I also faced some challenges attempting to install Django, in which the installer was giving me an error for lacking a virtualenv. I got around that by creating the virtual environment and activating it before running the command `pip install django`. 

Another challenge was making sure the server, would indeed, run. When I initially execute the command `python manage.py runserver`, it returned with errors, limiting my ability to confirm that my installation was proper because Django was not installed properly in my virtual environment. Once I double checked and verified that I was inside the venv, I was able to resolve the race condition. Setting up Git and the remote repository took a little time, especially generating SSH keys and adding them, but it helped me learn about why it's important to configure version control on a real project.
